## Tools Needed
- **Python**: Download from python.org (3.10 or later)
- **Code Editor**: VS Code (recommended)
- **SQL**: MySQL Workbench or PostgreSQL + pgAdmin
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive Python

## Installation Guide

### Python Setup
```bash
# Windows
1. Download from python.org
2. Install (check "Add to PATH")
3. Verify: python --version

# Install essential packages
pip install pandas numpy jupyter matplotlib seaborn
```

### SQL Setup
```bash
# MySQL
1. Download MySQL Community Server
2. Install MySQL Workbench
3. Create local database for practice
```

## Practice Strategy

### Python
1. Code every day (even 30 minutes)
2. Type code manually (don't copy-paste)
3. Break down complex problems
4. Build small projects

### SQL
1. Practice on real databases
2. Solve 5 problems daily
3. Focus on JOINs and subqueries
4. Optimize queries for performance

## Mini Projects

### Python Project
**Sales Data Analyzer**
- Read CSV file with sales data
- Clean and transform data
- Calculate metrics (total sales, average, top products)
- Export results to new CSV

### SQL Project
**E-commerce Database Analysis**
- Create tables (customers, orders, products)
- Insert sample data
- Write queries for business insights
- Generate reports

## Success Metrics
By end of Week 2, you should:
- ✅ Write Python scripts confidently
- ✅ Manipulate data with Pandas
- ✅ Write complex SQL queries
- ✅ Join multiple tables
- ✅ Solve 20+ SQL problems
- ✅ Complete 2 mini projects

## Daily Checklist
- [ ] 1 hour: Theory/Tutorial
- [ ] 2 hours: Hands-on coding
- [ ] 1 hour: Practice problems
- [ ] 30 min: Review and document

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Watching tutorials without coding along
2. Not practicing enough problems
3. Skipping fundamentals to jump to advanced topics
4. Not documenting your learning

## Next Steps
After completing Week 1-2:
- Move to [Week 3: Statistics & Visualization](../Week-03-Statistics-Visualization/README.md)
- Keep practicing SQL daily (15-30 min)
- Start thinking about data in your daily life
